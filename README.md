# Godot2File

This Python script allows you to download and process files from any Godot project hosted in any GitHub repository. This makes it easier to share and analyze Godot projects with AIs like ChatGPT that have large context capabilities but don't always automatically download code from GitHub.

## Features

- Download and process files from a GitHub repository
- Support for both public and private repositories
- Identify and categorize Godot-specific files (GDScript, scenes, resources, project configurations)
- Compile all extracted information into a structured text format
- Specify a branch or tag to download from (default: "master")
